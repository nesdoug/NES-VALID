How to use...

Run Valid.py in a command prompt or terminal emulator, and type

    $ python3 Valid.py <path_to_nes_file>
    
It will give a description of the NES header info, and tell you if the filesize matches the header.
This should help pinpoint errors in headers, such as incorrect # of PRG banks.
